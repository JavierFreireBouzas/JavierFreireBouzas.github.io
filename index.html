            <h3><b>About Me</b></h3>
            <p>Born in Carballo (A Coruña) on 4th of March of 2002. He is a Software Engineering student at University of A Coruña, in the last course of the degree. After finishing his studies at the secondary 
                school and thinking a lot, he decided to start a degree on Computer Science at University of A Coruña in order to take advantage of the
                skills he had learned in different subjects of the school. Later, at the third course of the degree, he decided to take the specialization of 
                Software Engineering because it was the one that he liked the most since he started the University.
            </p>
            <p>Now, he is finishing the degree and searching for a company with the objective of learning how to work in real environments and acquire more skills related with his studies.</p>
